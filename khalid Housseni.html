    <p class="fydor-p"><strong>Khaled Hosseini</strong>
        (born March 4, 1965, Kabul, Afghanistan) is an Afghan-born American novelist who is known for his vivid depictions of Afghanistan, most notably in The Kite Runner (2003).
    </p>
    <p class="fydor-p">Hosseini grew up in Kabul; his father was a diplomat and his mother a secondary-school teacher. In 1976 he and his parents moved to Paris, where his father worked at the Afghan embassy. With the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, they found returning to their home impossible, and they moved to California,
         having been granted political asylum by the United States.</p>
         <p class="fydor-p">Hosseini attended Santa Clara University, where he studied biology, and in 1989 he began attending medical school at the University of California, San Diego. He entered private practice as an internist in 1996, 
            three years after receiving his medical degree.
            Hosseini began working in 2001 on The Kite Runner, writing at 4:00 am before heading to his medical practice. The novel’s narrator is Amir, a writer who lives in California in the present day but who grew up in the 1970s in Kabul, the privileged son of a wealthy family. Amir’s story centers on his childhood friendship with Hassan, the son of a family servant, and its subsequent dissolution. The Kite Runner was praised for its powerful storytelling, but it was, at times, dismissed by critics for elements considered melodramatic. Nonetheless, the novel soon gained wide popularity through readers’ word-of-mouth praise, and it was eventually
             published in more than three dozen countries; film and theater adaptations both appeared in 2007.
        </p>
        <h2 class="fydor-h2">Plot</h2>
        <p class="fydor-p">The Kite Runner chronicles the journey of Amir from the 1970s. Amir’s father, whom Amir calls Baba, is a wealthy and respected Afghan businessman, and their upper-class status is reflected in their large house and comparatively lavish lifestyle. Amir and Baba have two servants, Ali and his son, Hassan, who live in a small shack within their property’s compound. Ali and Hassan are Hazaras, an ethnic minority in Afghanistan, and they face considerable discrimination throughout the book.

            The first part of the novel details Amir’s close relationship with Hassan. Amir’s first-person account describes his idyllic childhood, filled with skipping stones, reading Afghan folktales, and flying kites. Hassan is skilled at using a sling, and he acts as kite runner for Amir—which means that he retrieves fallen kites that Amir has brought down during kite fights, a sport in which the goal is to cut opponents’ kite strings by using one’s own and to be the owner of the last kite flying. Despite Hassan’s low social status and his lack of education, Amir harbors a deep-seated jealousy toward Hassan because of the attention he receives from Baba. Amir teases Hassan and mocks him for not being able to read.
             Amir’s own sense of inadequacy is compounded as Hassan demonstrates acts of selfless
             bravery to protect Amir against several childhood bullies, a bravery that Amir wishes he could emulate.</p>
