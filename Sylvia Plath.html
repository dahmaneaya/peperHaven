        <p class="fydor-p"><strong> Sylvia Plath</strong> (born October 27, 1932, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.—died February 11, 1963, London, England) was an American poet whose best-known works, such as the poems “Daddy” and “Lady Lazarus” and the novel The Bell Jar, starkly express a sense of alienation and self-destruction closely tied to her personal experiences and,
             by extension, the situation of women in mid-20th-century America.</p>

             <p class="fydor-p">Plath published her first poem at age eight. She entered and won many literary contests, and, while still in high
                 school, she sold her first poem to The Christian Science Monitor and her first short story to Seventeen magazine. She entered Smith College on a scholarship in 1951 and was a cowinner of the Mademoiselle magazine fiction contest in 1952. At Smith Plath achieved considerable artistic, academic, and social success, but she also suffered from severe depression, attempted suicide, and underwent a period of psychiatric hospitalization. She graduated from Smith with highest honours in 1955 and went on to Newnham College in Cambridge, England, on a Fulbright fellowship. In 1956 she married the English poet Ted Hughes; 
                they had two children. The couple separated in 1962, after Hughes’s affair with another woman.</p>

                <p class="fydor-p"> During her last three years Plath abandoned the restraints and conventions that had bound much of her early work. She wrote with great speed, producing poems of stark self-revelation and confession. The anxiety, confusion, and doubt that haunted her were transmuted into verses of great power and pathos borne on flashes of incisive wit. Her poem “Daddy” and several others explore her conflicted relationship with her father, Otto Plath, who died when she was age eight.
                     In 1963, after this burst of productivity, she took her own life</p>

                   <p class="fydor-p">The Collected Poems, which includes many previously unpublished poems, appeared in 1981 and received the 1982 Pulitzer Prize for poetry, making Plath the first to receive the honour posthumously. A book for children that she had written in 1959, The It-Doesn’t-Matter Suit,
                     was published in 1996. Interest in Plath and her works continued into the 21st century. She had kept a journal for much of her life, and in 2000 The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath, covering the years from 1950 to 1962, was published. A biographical film of Plath starring Gwyneth Paltrow (Sylvia) appeared in 2003. In 2009 Plath’s radio play Three Women (1962) was staged professionally for the first time. A volume of Plath’s letters, written in 1940–56, was published in 2017. A second collection—which contained her later letters
                     , including a number of candid notes to her psychiatrist—appeared the following year.
                     In 2019 the story Mary Ventura and the Ninth Kingdom, written in 1952, was published for the first time.</p>
